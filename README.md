- `goodreads_data_dictionary.csv` ‚Äî Data dictionary for understanding the datasets

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Run Locally

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The full reviews dataset is too large for GitHub and Streamlit Cloud. You must download it separately (instructions below), or use a smaller sample version for deployment.

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmilioMonteLuna/GoodReadsProject.git
cd GoodReadsProject
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Load the Datasets

#### Option A: Use Full Dataset (Locally)

- Create a `Data/` folder and place the following CSVs inside:

```
Data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goodreads_works.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goodreads_reviews.csv  ‚Üê (must be downloaded manually)
```

You can download the full `goodreads_reviews.csv` from the [Maven Bookshelf Challenge dataset](https://maven-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Goodreads+Book+Reviews/Goodreads+Book+Reviews.zip).  
Ensure the file is named exactly `goodreads_reviews.csv`.

#### Option B: Use Sample Dataset (Recommended for Deployment)

- Use a smaller sample like `goodreads_reviews_sample.csv` to avoid memory/time issues.
- To create a sample, run:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("Data/goodreads_reviews.csv")
df.sample(5000, random_state=42).to_csv("Data/goodreads_reviews_sample.csv", index=False)
```

---

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run ReadingListProgram.py
```

Open your browser to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to Streamlit Cloud

Because of size limitations, **do not include the full reviews file in your GitHub repository**. Instead:

1. Add the file to `.gitignore`:
    ```bash
    # Ignore large dataset
    Data/goodreads_reviews.csv
    ```
2. Modify your code to:
    - Check if the file exists
    - Use a smaller file like `goodreads_reviews_sample.csv` if not

3. Push and deploy using Streamlit Cloud
